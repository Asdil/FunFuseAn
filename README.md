This is the open source toolkit for our MBIA-MICCAI 2019 paper titled 'Structural Similarity based Anatomical and Functional Brain Imaging Fusion' [N.Kumar et al](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03958) which performs following tasks:

* Develops a novel end-to-end unsupervised fusion algorithm based for anatomical and functional imaging modalities such as using Convolutional Neural Networks.
* Develops a mathematical framework to visualise the fused image using the partial derivatives with respect to the input imaging modalities.
* Compares the proposed fusion + visualisation method with other state-of-the-art fusion methods.
