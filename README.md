The paper performs the following tasks:
* Develops a novel end-to-end unsupervised fusion algorithm for anatomical and functional imaging modalities using Convolutional Neural Networks.
* Develops a mathematical framework to visualise the fused image using the partial derivatives with respect to the input imaging modalities.
* Compares the proposed fusion + visualisation method with other state-of-the-art fusion methods.
